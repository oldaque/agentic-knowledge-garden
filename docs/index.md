# Agentic Knowledge Garden

**Agentic Knowledge Garden** is a public repository designed to organize and share knowledge about **building AI agents**, combining **research, practice, and curation** in one place.

It works like a **knowledge garden** — a space where ideas start as simple notes, grow with references and experiments, and eventually evolve into guides, patterns, or reusable examples.

---

## 🌱 Purpose
To gather concepts, patterns, and practices around agentic AI development in an organized, accessible, and evolving way.  
Every contribution starts small (as a note) and can grow over time as understanding deepens.

## 🧭 Structure

```bash
docs/
├─ README.md
├─ index.md
├─ assets/
├─ guide/      # structured chapters and consolidated knowledge
├─ patterns/   # recurring design patterns for agent systems
├─ resources/  # curated references, papers, authors, and links
├─ snippets/   # small illustrative code or prompt snippets
├─ examples/   # practical and reproducible examples
└─ notes/      # starting point for raw notes and discoveries
```

**Notes → Decisions → Promotions**
Each piece of content begins in `notes/`. From there, it can be promoted to another section:

* `guide/` for structured and educational material
* `patterns/` for recurring agent design patterns
* `resources/` for curated references and sources
* `snippets/` for short, reusable code blocks
* `examples/` for complete, working demonstrations

## 📚 How to Navigate

### 🔸 `notes/`

Raw notes and idea sketches. Use this section to capture insights, references, and exploratory thinking.

### 🔸 `guide/`

Consolidated content explaining topics in a structured or sequential way. Best for continuous reading.

### 🔸 `patterns/`

A catalog of patterns and architectures for AI agents. Each file defines a problem, the applied pattern, and practical examples.

### 🔸 `resources/`

Curated links, articles, papers, and authors relevant to agentic AI development.

### 🔸 `snippets/`

Short, ready-to-use code or prompt snippets derived from notes or examples.

### 🔸 `examples/`

Minimal working projects that demonstrate key concepts in practice.

## 🧩 Contributing

You can:

* Add new **notes** to expand the knowledge base
* Consolidate notes into structured **guide chapters**
* Add **patterns** or **references** to existing sections
* Improve, organize, or review existing content

Use Markdown for all files and follow the structure defined in each section’s `section_file_schema.yml`.
